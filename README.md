# US-to-CAD-Exchange-Rate-Forecasting
An attempt to forecast the US to CAD Exchange Rate- Inspired by a school project

One can view a Shiny app [here.](https://braydentang1.shinyapps.io/excaus_forecast/) that summarizes the results of this repository.

This project is inspired by what my friend (Riley Peters) and I did in our term project at the University of Regina, however, with a much greater emphasis on:

1) Forecasting and forecasting performance over general time series analysis,
2) Utilizing cross validation in a time series context in which models are dynamically refit per each slice of time.
3) Shorter term forecasts; the term project we did prioritized 12 month ahead forecasts which were unlikely to be accurate given how long the time frame is.
