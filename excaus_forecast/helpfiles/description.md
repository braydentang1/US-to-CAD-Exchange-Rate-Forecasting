# Forecasting the US to CAD Exchange Rate

This app seeks to provide three month ahead forecasts for a chosen period. All forecasts generated (including past ones where the true values of the exchange rate are now known) are out of sample.

These methods have been chosen because they give similar performance when validated separately using walk forward cross validation.
